# Shader Background with UnicornStudio.js

This project demonstrates how to use [UnicornStudio.js](https://github.com/hiunicornstudio/unicornstudio.js/tree/v1.4.18) to create a beautiful shader-based background for your web page.

## How it works
- The background shader is embedded using UnicornStudio's CDN and the provided project ID.
- The shader is rendered as a fixed, full-viewport background.
- You can place your content above the shader background using the `.content` div.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. The shader background will load automatically.
3. Customize the `.content` section as needed for your site.

## Customization
- To use a different shader, change the `data-us-project` attribute in `index.html` to your desired project ID from UnicornStudio.
- Adjust the CSS for layout tweaks as needed.
